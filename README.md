# Dotfiles

The dotfiles repository contains all the necessary configurations files and installation guidelines needed, to get a fully functional OS up and running quickly. 
It does not contain super deep configurations that are being made to very specific programs, only for programs and tools which are commonly used by me on my computers at home and at work.

#### Operating System

There are many debates on the internet regarding which operating system is the best. Particularly in the linux-community, the distro-discussion is always very active.
For me, Debian is the most suitable operating system. It is a stable and relatively fast and lightweigh OS, and super reliable.
